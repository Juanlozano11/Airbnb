# Airbnb
Airbnb ratings of hosts over years. 


This project will represent the data review_score_rating and since_year_host. These two pieces of data are all we need to make our graph as it will use the since_year_host as the year on the x-axis, and it will use the average review_score_rating of every year as it's y-axis


Project with Ahmed Ali.
